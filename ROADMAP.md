Bugs:
When you size from mobile to desktop, then back to mobile, the text wrap gets messed up.
When you view the page using a Chromebook, the font under the Items tab is messed up.

Next Steps:
Dan: Get recipe ingredient images into folder, make sure they are consistent sizes.
Nick: Migrate index.html to template.html and implemenet the constants from constants.py

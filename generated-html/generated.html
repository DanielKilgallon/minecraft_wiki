        While Stable Ender Pearls are used in various crafting recipes they also have a purpose on their own. When you you right click a stable ender pearl in your hand it will be bound to you. When it's dropped on the ground it will teleport the player it's bound to to itself after 7 seconds. If it's not bound to anyone it will instead teleport a random entity in a 10 block radius to itself.
